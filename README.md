## My process/ What I learned
I built this with a flexbox layout, I started with the mobile design first, which was my first one that I started that way and I'm really happy with how it turned out. At first it was difficult to get used to the new way but then it's much easier to scale up from there actually, so I plan to use that more in the future. I started with the picture, and made a div for the word contents under that, I did styling, and watched a video about responsive design using the Utopia Type Scale Calculator, which made everything so much easier once I implemented that. Overall I learned so much about responsive design through this project. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Utopia Type Scale Calculator


### Useful resources

The video that I watched was on youtube from Kevin Powell on responsive design.
